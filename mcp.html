<h2> intro </h2>
 
 This tutorial will cover how to get a working MCP environment setup for mod
 development. Some knowledge of working with the shell on your OS of choice is
 assumed. The tutorial uses MCP 4.3 for beta 1.7.3, but should be the same for
 earlier versions.

<hr>

<h2> tutorial </h2>

 First, download MCP from 
<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Programs_and_editors/Mod_Coder_Pack">here</a>.
 Scroll down the see the downloads table. Unzip it somewhere. The zip will
 probably NOT be a self-contained folder, so put it in one first before
 extracting.
 
 <p>

 If you are on linux, you will probably need to install wine.

 <p>

 Now, we need to edit one of MCP's scripts that was broken sometime during
 the seven years since these versions were created. Open runtime/decompile.py
 and comment out line 503 by adding a "#" to the start. It should look like
 this:

 <p>

 <code>
#    commands.checkupdates()
 </code>

 <p>

 Now we add the minecraft.jar and associated files. We need to end up with the
 following structure:

 <p> <code>
jars/ 
└── bin 
    ├── jinput.jar 
    ├── lwjgl.jar 
    ├── lwjgl_util.jar 
    ├── minecraft.jar 
    ├── natives 
    └── server.properties 
 </code> <p>

 Note that natives/ MUST contain the correct natives for your OS.

 <p>

 At this point you can add mods to the minecraft.jar, they should decompile
 fine (though MCP will complain about a modified jar being used). Since the
 rest of these tutorials will use Modloader, and you should use Modloader, now
 is a good time to install Modloader.

 <p>

 Do it!

 <p>

<h2> testing the setup </h2>

 From this point on, whenever a script is referred to, we mean the one for
 your platform. That would be a .sh for OSX, Linux, or any other Unix-like,
 and .bat for windows.

 <p>

 MCP should be setup now. We will test this by decompiling, recompiling, and
 running Minecraft.

 <p>

 Run decompile to decompile the game. This will take a little while, but if
 all goes well you will end up with a directory "src" containing the game's
 source code! You will probably get an error about failed hunks in
 RenderBlocks, this can be ignored.

 <p>

 Test recompilation by running recompile followed by reobfuscate. Recompile
 will recompile the source files into java bytecode, while reobfuscate will
 change all the symbol names back to the way they are in an unmodified jar.
 You need to do this if you want to distribute your changes.

 <p>

 At this point, you can assume you have a functional MCP instance, and can
 start developing! yay!

 <p>

 We'll run through the rest of the scripts briefly now, as some of them are
 useful (and others dangerous!)

 <p>

 Cleanup will reset the working directory back to an empty state, taking your
 work with it! Be careful with it! Backup your work!

 <p>

 Startclient will launch Minecraft (specifically the result of the last
 recompile). This is useful for testing, as you don't need to package and
 install your mods into another client.

 <p>

 Startserver will run the server, which we didn't set up because I do not know
 where to find a vanilla beta 1.7.3 server jar. If you know where to find one,
 let me know! Until that happens, this script will do nothing of use.

 <p>

 Updatemcp will not work and will probably break your install. You might want
 to delete it, just to be safe.

 <p>

 Similarly, updatenames and updatemd5 will probably break your install. These
 ones probably <i>will</i> work, but I don't know what exactly they do, other
 than update something related to the obfuscation mappings.

<p>

<h2> end </h2>

That's the end of this tutorial. If you are stuck somewhere, try reading the
MCP docs (docs/), or contact me and ask. If your setup seems to work, move on
to the other tutorials and start making mods!
