<h2> about </h2>

Note: this is a clone of a mod by ChocolatySyrup. The original download is
dead and was never updated past beta 1.5 to begin with. You can find the
original thread 
<a
href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272408-v-1-5_01-syrups-mods-furniture-stained-glass">here</a>.

<p>

Note two: I write a tutorial on how to create this mod! The link is on the
main page.

<p>

This mod adds a semi-renewable source of clay through a "clay sieve". 
The sieve converts dirt into clay using a hoe, water, a source of heat, and
time.

<p> 
You craft the sieve like this:

<p>
 
After putting it down, you can add dirt by right clicking. The dirt then needs
to be "sifted" by right clicking with a hoe, and then wetted by adding a
bucket of water. Then the clay needs to dry over time, meaning it must either
be in the sun, or near a source of fire or lava. "Within" means in a three
block square centered on the sieve, either at the same Y level or one lower.
Without a source of heat the clay will never dry!

<p>

After a while, the clay will dry and the sieve can be right clicked to harvest
three to eight clay balls!

<p>

Note, the drying time will be faster if a stronger source of heat is used.
Fire is stronger than sunlight, and lava is stronger than fire. You only need
one heat source per sieve, adding more will NOT speed it up!
