<h2> about </h2>
 
This mod makes changes to how mining works,
as for a game ostensibly about mining and
crafting, vanilla offers a rather lackluster
experience.

<p>

The mod is designed around making mining a
process that requires thought and planning,
rather than strip-mining at y12. Making 
minecarts useful and necessary is part of
this.

<a href="or.html">ore rebalance</a> 
is highly recommended, as is
<a href="bbb.html">boosters and better boats</a>

<p>

The major change is that ore no longer
stacks. Transporting large amounts of ore
efficiently is going to involve designing
a rail network with any necessary switches
and logic to route chest carts to and
from a smelting facility.

<p>

It's fun, trust me.

<p>

To make this possible without grinding for
iron to make rails in the early game,
the rails recipe has been changed to
produce 64 instead of 16 per craft.

<p>

It's not implemented yet, but I'm working
on improving smelting for large quantities
of ore. I admit it's a bit tedious right now.
